## About me....
As a robotics engineer, I work at Manara University as a robotics coach. I consider myself proficient in a wide range of professional talents, such as Python, C++, Arduino, MATLAB, AI, classic control theory, and Webots, to name just a few. Currently, this is my third year of employment; the first year I coached placed fifth in the National World Robotics Olympiad, and the second year they placed third. Right now, my primary objective is to become more proficient in robotics in order to expand my knowledge and enrich my skills. My personal goal is to launch my own robotics and artificial intelligence company with training facilities so that I can impart my skills to others and use the business to make a contribution to the area. I'm constantly keen to learn new things and explore the limits of AI and robots. My leadership and teaching abilities have improved as a result of coaching, and I remain flexible because of my practical expertise with intelligent control and motion planning. I'm motivated by a desire to truly impact the field and a love for innovation.
